    \begin{itemize}
        \item Affine Transformation between global and local volumes.
            \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine\_transformation}
        \item Position and Momentum should be considered.
        \item Now, we can calculate the transformation according to 
              the full path of Physical Volume.
        \item To avoid the too much calculation, we cache these values.
        \item Caveats
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The path must be complete.
                \item Can't handle the volumes with same name 
                        but different copyno.
                \item Depends on Geant4 Kernel.
            \end{itemize}
        \item other implementations
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In GenTools, the transformer is using DetDesc in Gaudi.
                \item ROOT also supply these utilities.
                \item Their basic ideas are same: Calculate the affine
                    transformation between mother and daughter.
                \item But their interfaces seems more powerful.
            \end{itemize}
        \item We need a more flexible service and some utilities 
            to supply the geometry infomation of the detector.
            
    \end{itemize}
