\subsection{Transfer Request Service and Dataset Service}

The transfer request service support a basic management which includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item create a new transfer request.
    \item list the transfer requests.
    \item show the status of the specific transfer request.
    \item kill one transfer process in a specific transfer request.
    \item re-transfer one transfer process.
\end{itemize}
The user use a dataset name, source SE and destination SE to create a 
new request. The user can also specify the protocol to transfer the files.

The dataset management does not support well when we create the transfer 
system. In our requirement, we need a static dataset whose file list
is immutable. We use an table to save these static files.
But now, DIRAC support the dataset management in DFC, so the dataset
service in our system is deprecated.
