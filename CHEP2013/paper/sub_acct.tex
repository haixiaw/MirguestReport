\subsection{Accounting}

Even though there is a type called {\tt DataOperation} in {\tt DIRAC}
accounting system, a new type called {\tt DataTransfer}
is introduced to avoid ambiguousness between transfer system
and other systems in {\tt DIRAC}.
The accounting system 
in {\tt DIRAC} is flexible. Referring to figure \ref{fig:acct},
what a data type is and how this data is shown
are needed,
therefore two classes derived from {\tt BaseAccountingType}
and {\tt BaseReporter} are defined respectively.
When a user sends a plotting request in the web portal, 
DIRAC will invoke the reporter automatically.
