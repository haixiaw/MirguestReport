\subsection{User Interface}
There are two types of User Interface: one is the command line scripts and 
another is the web portal. 
They are all simple wrappers for the RPC Call which are interaction
with {\tt BESDIRAC}.
The web portal for {\tt BESDIRAC} uses Pylons and ExtJS2 in server side and
client side respectively\cite{bib:webportal}. {\tt BESDIRAC} web portal supports
transfer request management, dataset management and  
accounting of the transfer system. An example is shown in figure
\ref{fig:ui}.

In {\tt BESDIRAC}, we organize the web portal related code into one
directory called {\tt Web}. There is a file called \verb"web.cfg"
which is used to load the menu entries into the menu bar in {\tt DIRAC} 
web portal. {\tt DIRAC} web portal support an uniform interface including
the systems in DIRAC and extensions.
Even though the {\tt DIRAC} project and {\tt DIRACWeb} are divided into
two different projects, there are relations between these two projects. 
Therefore, the {\tt Web} modules of {\tt BESDIRAC} is distributed 
with {\tt BESDIRAC} together to make the consistency in the project.
