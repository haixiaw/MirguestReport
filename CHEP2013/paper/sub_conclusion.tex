\section{Conclusion and outlook}
We presented the design and implementation of BESDIRAC transfer system.
We test this system with small dataset and large dataset.
The transfer of small dataset seems okay while the transfer of large
dataset still had some problems.

The development of BESDIRAC transfer system is still ongoing.
The kernel will be improved.
The accounting will give more information.
The integration of dataset management in DFC will be considered too.
