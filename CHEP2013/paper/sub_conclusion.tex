\section{Conclusion and outlook}
We have presented the design and implementation of {\tt BESDIRAC} transfer system
and had test with large datasets in this system.
There is also a web portal for users to manage their own transfer requests
and view the accounting more easily.
We benefit from the flexibility of {\tt DIRAC}.

The development of {\tt BESDIRAC} transfer system is still ongoing.
The kernel will be improved.
The accounting will give more information.
In the future, the integration of dataset management in 
{\tt DFC} will be considered too.
