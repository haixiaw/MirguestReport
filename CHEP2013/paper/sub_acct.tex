\subsection{Accounting}

The accounting system 
in {\tt DIRAC} is flexible. Refer to figure \ref{fig:acct},
we only need to define 
what a data type is and how this data will be shown.
When a user send a plotting request in the web portal, 
DIRAC will call these methods automatically.
Even though there is a type called {\tt DataOperation} in {\tt DIRAC},
we define our own type. We don't want to mix the data between 
transfer system and the other systems in {\tt DIRAC}.
It is also a try to have our own data type.
