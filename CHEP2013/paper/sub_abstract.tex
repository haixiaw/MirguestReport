Data transfer is an essential part in grid.
In the BESIII experiment, the result of Monte Carlo Simulation should 
be transfered back from other sites to IHEP and the DST files for physics analysis 
should be transfered from IHEP to other sites. A robust transfer system should 
make sure all data are transfered correctly.

{\tt DIRAC} consists of cooperation distributed services
and light-weight agents delivering the workload to the Grid Resources.
We reuse the most functionalities supplied by {\tt DIRAC}.
{\tt BESDIRAC} is an extension to {\tt DIRAC} for BES specified. In {\tt BESDIRAC}, 
a Dataset-based Data Transfer System is developed.
In this paper, we present the design of this system and its implementation
details.
