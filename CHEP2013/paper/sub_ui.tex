There are two types of User Interface: one is the command line scripts and 
another is the web portal. 
They are all simple wrappers for the RPC Call which are interaction
with {\tt BESDIRAC}.
The web portal for {\tt BESDIRAC} uses Pylons and ExtJS2 in server side and
client side respectively\cite{bib:webportal}. {\tt BESDIRAC} web portal supports
transfer request management, dataset management and  
accounting of the transfer system. An example is shown in figure
\ref{fig:ui}.
